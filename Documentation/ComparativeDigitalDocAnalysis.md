# An introduction to Comparative Digital Document Analysis

Comparative Digital Document Analysis is based, in part, on an analytical framework for any digital documents that aims to compare how much they are actively involved in altering the computational state of the computer, and not merely any final analogue output.  It focusses on the relationship between the main computing model (whether we analyse it as simple input-output or not) and at what point analogue representions (like text) are requested, and for what purpose.

In my view, the fact that digital information is used for analogue representations that humans can read should not mean that a 'digital document' is defined by the analogue representation.  However, by the time a human recognises any standard output as a recognisable 'document' the computing processes are already underway, and some concept of how to structure the document is already in play.  It is too late to be referring to analogue representations as the basis for defining digital documents and digital structures.  The horse has already bolted.

The bias that the layperson or a programmer has toward readable digital documents is natural: these are the ones we interact with.  However, such interaction is itself carefully provided for by software that represents text on screen.  It is merely one branch of a computing process.  A browser, for example, can choose to make HTML code, otherwise a <i>preceding</i> step in the computational model, available as another analogue output.  This is done by 'view source'.  But this does not prevent the same browser continuing to act on that content to provide the analogue representation.  Rather than think of a single input-output design, we can think of analogue representations as often concerned with computing processes that are in incomplete states. 

Our ability to interact with the computer is never a fixed state, but one that is always designed by custom software to allow it to happen, even when we are writing and programming.  Rather than think of software designed for analogue representations (of 'documents') as being a special case, we should think of analogue representations as being optional: a kind of opportunity to create break points into computing, ones that allow humans to see the state of a work-in-progress.  This work could be the memory state of a runnning program, or it could even be the state of a program yet to be executed, or a written document yet to be put into publishable form.

# Informed upstream processing and work-in-progress

By adopting a functional definition for digital documents that includes some consideration of how computing processes might be able to make use of writer's data, we can move toward more deliberate processes and writer-specific programming languages that can be woven into analogue representations of work-in-process, rather than in something only conceived of as a final document. 

This is not entirely new.  For example, Markdown syntax is a kind of break-point language, in that it allows a person to work with an analogue representation prior to the formulation of HTML.  However, it is a reaction to HTML, rather than being a positive construction of the semantic categories that are important to the writer, and ways to leverage computing for the writer's benefit (other than through more type-strokes).

For any analogue break-point, thinking about the state of the computer's memory (rather than the specific output), is helpful for thinking about software that can assist the writer with useful work-in-process functions.  If a writer has access to their own semantic information, in an analogue form, and can then issue further instructions for the remainder of the computing process, then this allows more nuanced interaction between the writer and the computer.  The presence of analogue representations, programming functions and opportunities for the writer to act on work-in-progress representations, rather than just the final analogue representation, is a more powerful model of computing.  The point is, that it is not the fact that we can see the document on the screen that is important: what is important is how much the computer environment is prepared to process the file for different functions, and how much the human writer is prepared to take advantage of that deliberate computing model. An earlier part of the document can setup conditions that will then be used for intepreting later parts of the document.   This turns out to work quite well for the regular structure of literature, like plays, which also have a time-based structure, and are concerned with introductory semantic information (like the characters), which can be useful to both human readers and computer-based interpreters of that information. 

# Implications for text editing software

Another observation is that even a basic text editor provides some analogue representation, because this is how a human reads it, but its place in a computing workflow is discretionary.  Where we choose to place that analogue representation in a computing process, is, however, completely up to us.  Not only can any digital file exist simultaneously as both an analogue representation and one that is capable for computation, but the nature and effect of it can be altered by programs upstream and downstream of it.  

By taking this observation and thinking about how it might apply to the whole process of computing, from input to output, we can ensure that the notion of analogue representation does not become a limitation on how we interpret and process digital texts for any purpose, not merely for software engineering.
