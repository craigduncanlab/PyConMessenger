# Explanation of the Modified terms of MIT Licence

At this early stage in the project, I am happy for you to seek to modify the terms of this licence by contacting me and asking me for consent in writing.  Please send any communication by using [Mastodon](https://mastodon.au/@craigduncan) (polite, direct messages for this purpose are preferred and encouraged).

My reason for not permitting commercial use is important to me, especially where we are currently seeing unethical data scraping practices for chat and LLM apps (frequently and misleadingly called 'AI') that are deriving vast amounts of revenue without accountability.  

I take into account that even Laurent Richardson, the developer of useful python software like Beautiful Soup, has lamented his difficulty in keeping away bad actors, and not being able to raise revenue using a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licence, whilst also being resigned that his software will be used for good and bad purposes by people who are able to commercially exploit it.  It is clear that he values ethical behaviour, as this extract on his web-zine illustrates:

```
Sometimes beautiful Soup is used to do something really important, often as a piece of journalism. (My favorite example.)

But it's also been used as a tool for spamming, doxing, and other things I think are unethical.

And it's often used in ways that make rich people richer. ðŸ“ˆ

Maybe not unethical per se, but not the best use of the power we have as computer programmers
```

Above is an extract from [BeautifulSoup_Zine](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/zine/), by Laurent Richardson. Last accessed 13 September 2024.
â€ƒ

My views on ethical behaviour by rich people differ from Laurents.  In my view, it is not conducive to ethical practices to allow other, unspecified people to commercially exploit software without royalty payment if the developer of the software is left disappointed and unrewarded.  Exploitation is also more likely to occur if the same developer consciously allows this to happen by a permissive licence.  In that sense, Laurent's view of the 'power we have as computer programmers' is probably too dismissive of the power we have to control the terms upon which we interact and deal with other people.  It is sensible practice to create rules in the world, especially fair ones, and not leave the future to chance.  

It is implicit in the MIT Licence that 'dealing' is a recognised activity, but it misses an opportunity to have a say in both ethical and commercial dealings that are endorsed by the developer.  Sure, Google said they wouldn't do evil, and perhaps not everyone wants to think that evil is a purely subjective opinion.  In fact, some of these things are going to be defined by what we say and how we act, taken together.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't start by proactively demonstrating what we mean by good or bad behaviour in these licences, or reserving judgment to deal with things on a case by case basis.  These licences are a form of private law where we ought not give away powers that help ourselves and like-minded people make a better world.  This is the basis for our democracy and the rule of law.  We are not a rule-less civil society, nor are we required to adopt rules that ignore human nature.

In my case, I do not believe that we should passively allow unconditional commercial exploitation of software by third parties by silence or non-consent, especially if there is an imbalance of power and this is at the expense of the software developer (a form of unjust enrichment).  The fact is, that there are unconscionable people in the world who allow themselves to be knowingly enriched by the ethical work of others, if they can get away with it.  This is generally regarded as a bad idea. 

It should be clear that I do not agree with Laurent Richardson's approach, and that of FOSS in general, that we should simply accept this commercial exploitation as uncontrollable fate.  To the extent we can allow commercial exploitation under a FOSS, then until this project becomes sufficiently large and stable enough that this becomes an issue, I am happy to do my part to only encourage positive, ethical commercial projects, and not negative ones, without adopting generic rules to give up caring about this, based on an unrealistic view of human nature.

For the avoidance of doubt, amongst other things, you may not derive revenue by putting this information into a data scraping system for machine learning where the results are commercially exploited, or any computer system that commercialises the text output (including by advertising clicks).  Difficulty of estimating your revenue from such exploitation is not an excuse.

# Further explanation

The Markdown pages are not software.  However, my New Processor/MessengerHTML Project reconsiders whether there is, in fact, a clear distinction between writing and software.  The .txt and .ats files in the project are, arguably, a mix of both text and functions that, depending on the interpreter and computation model, can be used as instructions to a computer.  Part of my thesis is that a digital document's qualities as text or software are not absolute but relative: they depend on how it is used and interpreted within an abstract model of a computer, *before* (and if) it is made recognisable to human readers in analogue form.

That being the case, I think it may also be necessary to reconsider the sharp distinction between 'software licences' and text licences, at least in some instances where they are hybrid forms.  Perhaps the only representation that is truly 'text only' is the analogue form in which a human reader perceives a document (outside of the computing system itself).  Within the computing system, it is arguable that any digital text, as a form of digital information, can be made into instructions and therefore software.  Even markup 'languages' are, in a broad sense, a simple form of software, if appropriate software is written that provides the appropriate model of a computer.
