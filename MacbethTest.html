    <p class="Quote">They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought good to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.</p>
    <p id="P332" class="playline">Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be</p>
    <p id="P333" class="playline">What thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;</p>
    <p id="P334" class="playline">It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness</p>
    <p id="P335" class="playline">To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;</p>
    <p id="P336" class="playline">Art not without ambition, but without</p>
    <p id="P337" class="playline">The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,</p>
    <p id="P338" class="playline">That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,</p>

Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.</p>
