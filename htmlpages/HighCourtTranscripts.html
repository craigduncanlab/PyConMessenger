The plaintiffs require an order under<br>section 486A(2) of the &lt;i&gt;Migration Act&lt;/i&gt; extending the time for making<br>the applications.  Mr Hill, the Minister did not oppose that order, do you<br>oppose that order being<br>made? <br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MR HILL:&lt;/b&gt;   No, we consent to that<br>order being made, your Honour.<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HER HONOUR:&lt;/b&gt;   The order will<br>be that: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;ol&gt;<br>&lt;li style=&apos;&apos; value=&apos;1&apos; value=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The<br>period for the making of the applications by the first, second and third<br>plaintiffs for a constitutional or other writ to this<br>Court be extended to<br>27 February 2024.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second preliminary matter is that the<br>second plaintiff sought an order that she be appointed the litigation guardian<br>for the third,<br>fourth, and fifth plaintiffs.  That is also not opposed, Mr<br>Hill?<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MR HILL:&lt;/b&gt;   That is right, your Honour, that is not<br>opposed.<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HER HONOUR:&lt;/b&gt;   That order will also be made:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;ol&gt;<br>&lt;li style=&apos;&apos; value=&apos;2&apos; value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The<br>second plaintiff is appointed litigation for the third, fourth, and fifth<br>plaintiffs, pursuant to rule 21.08.6 of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_reg/hcr2004170/&quot; class=&quot;autolink_findacts&quot;&gt;High Court Rules 2004&lt;/a&gt;<br>&lt;/i&gt;(Cth).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the extent necessary, I will dispense with compliance<br>with rule 21.08.7.  The third preliminary matter on my list, and there may<br>very well be others, is this application by you, Ms Costello, to amend your<br>reply.  I might hear from Mr Hill first as to what his<br>reaction is to it<br>because I have had no notification in writing or otherwise from the defendant. <br>Mr Hill.<br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MR HILL:&lt;/b&gt;   Thank you, your Honour.  My<br>instructions are neither to oppose nor consent to that<br>application.<br></p><p id="P6" class="np">There is one semantic class used there (inside an anchor, or 'a' tag):</p><p class="example">class=&quot;autolink_findacts&quot;<br></p><p id="P7" class="np">This gives some indication of what is prioritised, i.e. isolated references to legislation over the encoding of the actors, speakers and flow of communications.
