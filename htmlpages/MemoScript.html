<p id="PLN1" class="intro">Intro</p><p id="P1" class="np">The name 'memo script' highlights the importance of being able to write specific memos, to self, family, academic peers, or to internet at large.  The conventional 'memo header' section contains basic details of date, author, topic which are useful to those kinds of documents.  This is not always set out so crudely in the web, but it can easily emulate old paper conventions.</p><p id="P2" class="np">The concept of a 'script' that is built around writing memos is to make it easier to do this without a full word processor, yet achieve relative ease in being able to write memos to the public.  Adding links and collections of images should be easy too.</p><p id="P3" class="np">The main goals of memoscript's design are the ability to write and publish quickly whilst being explicit about semantic categories.  Lists of information can be predefined and then used to generate formatted text, images with captions, tables, or references.  Any kind of data definition has the option of being tagged in HTML with the same label as the semantic class.  </p><p id="P4" class="np">Part of the goal of MemoScript is to allow interesting production of literature, with scope for doing neat things with texts and linking, that would not be possible if we didn't have expectations for a kind of intelligent writer who used it.  Why shouldn't it be easy to add notes and turn them on or off?  Word processors don't permit this because they aren't interested in even the smallest amount of critical and scholarly work - only factory-like production of text (i.e. in my view the phrase "word processing" is the central factory mantra i.e. the "Gutenberg Dogma")</p><p id="P5" class="np">See <a href="FontsFormattingTools.html" class="intlink">FontsFormattingTools</a> and <a href="LovelaceBabbagePadua.html" class="intlink">LovelaceBabbagePadua</a>.</p><p id="P6" class="np">Soundbite:</p><p class="example">MemoScript is a writing and publishing language for the humanities, built on the premise of plain text data and simple data commands.  It is useful for creating digital literature, communications and teaching materials for both web and legacy word processors.  It allows authors to use folders for their content management system, write in plain text, auto-tag literature, and remove dependence on proprietary software formats.<br></p><p id="PLN2" class="intro">Computable literature</p><p id="P7" class="np">Surprisingly, some forms of paper notebooks were capable of being considered texts/literature in that they allowed people to annotate/encode live events (e.g. sport) and keep track of them.  Certain double counting allow auditing etc.  The layout of the book would allow re-use of information (like the names entered into the team column), and for analogue 'mapping' (i.e. information on same line belonged to same 'player').</p><p id="P8" class="np">Graphical applications, or even computer applications in conventional programming languages would assume that information would be written mathematically in the underlying format, but then attached to a graphical user interface that would hide this data format.  This combination of science-central data formatting and hiding in a 'dumb' graphic interface is the standard paradigm for many computer applications today (even giving rise to the view-model-controller type paradigms and so on: 'view' is a euphemism for simple interfaces that hide the computing function to deliver what is essentially a manual, button-based interface, or something that uses non-text control to indicate user preferences. i.e. monkey buttons or leavers).</p><p id="P9" class="np">There is another approach, which is encapsulated in the design of Memoscript, namely to permit simple data definitions which are then used by the same text parser that is interpreting a text or literature.  By having access to this localised semantic information, text parsing becomes something more personalised, and, often, more efficient at interpreting what the author is doing in a normal document.</p><p id="P10" class="np">This personalisation idea can be reflected back to create new types of computable literature.  For example, by specifying the teams or players, and certain features that relate to them in text, the data that is used for a computable document can be personalised as if it is the data in memory when the document is processed.  This is a little bit like the way in which notebooks (R markdown, Jupiter etc) are created, except those programs promote a dynamic environment and some degree of graphical updates (e.g. converting markdown to HTML on the fly).  There are aspects of those notebooks in which code sections appear between text (i.e. text and code are conceptually different in scope - a bit like the traditional divide between mathematical notation and ordinary texts and literature).</p><p id="P11" class="np">My preference is to allow the option of turning data into text (e.g. lists can be printed lists, immediately), or stored as data that is then used when needed.</p><p id="P12" class="np">See <a href="CricketNotebooks.html" class="intlink">CricketNotebooks</a>.</p><p id="P13" class="np">You can use stored state of predefined information in conjunction with a sequence (log) of state changes and data updates to not only record the history of processes (as if a documentary log), but also to prepare new notes and literature that expands upon that state, or summarises it.  Computers are good at calculations, mathematical operations and summarisation.  However, the button-and-form based GUI types of software are a little limited in that a lot of time and software infrastructure is required to deliver a relatively rigid, software-centric program.  The rigidity comes about because the decision about what information is important has often been made, and it often reflects assumptions about scientific or empirical information, rather than literate information.   Software of this kind usually doesn't allow much scope for authors to write in additional notes that are useful during the process of updating their information.  The bloated forms of software GUI try to make a simulation of 'paper as a screen or machine' rather than 'screen-combined-with-writing device that also happens to be capable of decoding that writing and updating state'.   </p><p id="PLN3" class="intro">The scope for or exclusion of author subjectivity in processing of texts</p><p id="P14" class="np">In software designs where the GUI mediates user choice mainly through button/form methodologies (including Excel and database forms/templates, as well as templates set up in a datafield/text-replace workflow in some word processors)), data is treated as a constrained variable in a rigid system.  The software is opinionated about objectivity in that the authoring process is separated from data input: the user is not given the flexibility to engage with the entire process, alter its sequence, or how much of it is carried out.  Even though the final output may look like a letter, as a template it is already subject to controlling influences which turn some employee-authors into data entry clerks.  The significant aspect of this data-entry for a text to text-as-database relationship is that forms of expression that require interpretation as to what the computer will do, and in what order, are discouraged because the framing of data and information is so heavily based on the assumption that it is in that space where data is already reduced to sets and groups.  Writing as a form of communication and person expression, including writing about and with data, is excluded.  </p><p id="P15" class="np">The central dogma of these applications is that the data must be objective in that the author and their subjective concerns for what to write, how to write it, and how to process it, are excluded.</p><p id="P16" class="np">Respecting author intent with respect to computation is usually absent from conventional word processoring software; sometimes it is not given any attention.   The same could be said of content management software for the web: it does give greater attention to the writing of notes and inserting images, but it also offers a more formulaic assessment of what content is important and why.  Authors can't introduce explicit control over what is published or not published within each text box or blog entry, since that is considered a unit of information, rather than a form of writing in which the author's intent is still a live element in how and what is processed by the computer.</p><p id="P17" class="np">In a more script/notebook style, the relationship between computability and writing remains alive, and author intent can be explicit, even if it is not an intent designed for immediate publication or processing.  </p><p id="PLN4" class="intro">What implicit separations in the kind of information within literature are effected by digital software tools?</p><p id="P18" class="np">Even within notebooks, there are degrees to which an author can express any intent about the sequence of processing data, or whether it will proceed to publication.  One of the large benefits of relatively open notebook processing of literature is that the author retains some discretion over what is important to them, including how much is published, the nuancies of how it is published, and how much of the author's intellectual effort is retained in semantic categories.  </p><p id="P19" class="np">There are other kinds of notebooks, particularly those that have a low-level distinction between the 'text' and 'code' blocks, in which an author's ability to express their ideas about data are limited to whether they are coding or writing.  Although apparently a blend of computing and data science, the overlap is mainly confined to the ability to combine two distinct activities within the same scene (the same page), rather than actually allowing authors to reason with textual data and influence the flow of computation with respect to their writing.  It is actually a significant cognitive difference in being able to reason about the same things which may or may not constitute writing, or communication, and to treat them as data for some purposes and not others.   </p><p id="P20" class="np">In the notebooks that have been developed by the coding/software community, the discretion about publication is largely confined to things they know: i.e. there is a discretion with respect to whether a code block should be published as text (a form of scientific literature) or whether only its results will be published as part of the text.  However, the concepts within that code are themselves quarantined, in most if not all cases, from the concepts that relate to the writing. </p><p id="P21" class="np">Even in conventional texts, the idea of 'walls' or 'breaking the fourth wall' is a concept that arises out of the relationship between author, reader, characters and text.  That we can name this as a break to convention helps us describe something that exists as a relation, even if not a system.</p><p id="P22" class="np">See <a href="LovelaceBabbagePadua.html" class="intlink">LovelaceBabbagePadua</a>.</p><p id="PLN5" class="intro">Implications for design of tools</p><p id="P23" class="np">If we don't have a clear appreciation of what are the relevant cognitive and textual differences between different forms of media, like a paper cricket notepad versus a  graphical scoring app on a mobile phone, or a customised Excel spreadsheet, then we can't balance and discuss our relative preferences for things like general note-taking relevant to sports scoring, recording additional information in a way that it can be seen but also processed as data, and the ability to include optional information if time permits.</p><p id="P24" class="np">For example, if we follow conventional software design then archetypes of media influence how software is conceptualised.  A cricket scorebook might once have been a tally device, but over time, and with newer formats, it might adapt to a ball-by-ball record sheet.  When people think about how this translates to a computer, they might think of a spreadsheet (and all its assumptions about simulating a matrix of data), or they might think of a graphical application in which the 'time saving' element is assumed to be the ability to just tap on buttons instead of trying to write using an inconvenient keyboard.  The social context in which these activities occur, agreement on data formats, and the hardware or devices on which they are being used influence what people regard as appropriate.  Some people will be influenced by what hardware they have; a few others might make decisions about what hardware to bring to the event because of the convenience or functions that are offered by a different setup (e.g. a large keyboard might allow faster and more expansive typing; or a larger screen might be better; or longer battery life might be important; so too might be the ability to integrate the results with an internet-based, community scorign system).</p><p id="P25" class="np">For the experimentalist, a digital cricket notebook, available online without the need for specific software, might be an interesting piece of technology to try.  It may not even occur to people that there are advantages in typing text into text boxes that can be processed (as distinct from the lists, the need to search, retrieve etc).  e.g. typing player lists in where there is flexibility about spelling, names etc that can be updated at any time (or feedback can be given on subsequent references to these e.g. if there is a mismatch it can be noted when the processing of the log file is done).  </p><p id="P26" class="np">A more explicit approach to the data format and logging may not seem 'natural' to an app user, but to a scorer it might offer advantages that are in the circumstances such that they greatly outweight the apparently 'textual' nature of the interface.   Any bias in an app user for a buttons UI (and not writing data) might not be present in a scorer who understands the ease of updating, editing, changing information using traditional computer and keyboard.  There may be benefits in creating a log of the match that allows seeing the time-duration of the match in the same way we can read a book or a play, in that the sequence of text is a kind of spatial metaphor for the flow of time.</p><p id="P27" class="np">With this in mind, if a generic text or notebook processing app (e.g. using MemoScript) can be built to process cricket 'literature'  in the same way a play might be processed as data, and an application of pre-stored data).  That is, we might define a special kind of writing down features of a cricket match as 'literature' (an alternative to a normal cricket scoring book), and as a text, or literature, it is open to interpretation too.  It could capture the details like a Court stenographer might once have done in shortand).  However, abbreviations and semantic information recorded simultaneously in a digital format pave the way for a more regular interpretation and computation of the data than would be the case if it was recorded no differently to ordinary manuscript.   A program that can interpret the shorthand of the notes in this form of literature is aided by a shared convention between the writer and the program that interprets the notes: it is this language (e.g. memoscript) which, with some training, provides the rational basis for the interpretation function.</p><p id="P28" class="np">In summary, digital text as literature or digital text in the humanities can involve writing notes where computability is also alive, and where it is, then a language that helps identify semantic or contextual data of importance to the writer can thereby enable proper use of that information in computation. </p><p id="PLN6" class="intro">Literature example</p><p id="P29" class="np">It's possible the Folger Shakespeare project does employ some interpretation of state when it offers a simple program for identifying which characters are on stage at any time.  However the source format and processing for this appears to be hidden, and not readily connected to any of the data formats that they offer on the site.  A more generic and practical solution needs to be found, but the function offered still seems to be a worthwhile goal.  Perhaps MemoScript or similar is the way to do this.</p><p id="PLN7" class="intro">Lean encoding</p><p id="P30" class="np">Writing with a programmatic text interface is better than word processing in that it is capable of achieving the same end result but more efficiently:</p><p class="list">to achieve the same encoding of styles etc through simple text markings; </p><p class="list">Text markings save time (i.e. just a couple of characters instead of having to keep using a mouse and clicking buttons on a GUI toolbar that might keep changing).</p><p class="list">automation of default paragraph styles in text requires no additional effort</p><p class="list">some automation of patterns in styling of data actually save time.</p><p class="list">manual text markup may well be quicker than equivalent select text, find menu item, search for and apply style sequence in a word processor</p><p class="list">HTML output can occur from the processing of the text; it is more logical and effective to treat HTML as the primary intermediate form, rather than having to convert from WP format without quality control over the resultant HTML.</p><p id="P31" class="np">Not needing to be familiar with a GUI interface removes many of the complaints about software companies unilaterally changing familiar GUI interfaces, making old menu items harder to find and so on.  Significantly, producing suitable HTML means that the import of a document into a word processor will be even more semantically rich in style names, and the text will be encoded properly.  It will take less time to add data blocks to a text document in order to make relevant styles than it would take to keep adding styles manually through a GUI in the word processing environment.</p><p id="P32" class="np">For a sporting example see <a href="CricketNotebooks.html" class="intlink">CricketNotebooks</a>.</p><p id="PLN8" class="intro">Contrasts with conventional software; mobile apps</p><p id="P33" class="np">The ability to personalise documents, as a simple form of software is completely at odds with the assumptions that underpin both the content and development cycle of commercial software.  The commercial software development ecosystem normalises a system that treats excessive use of hardware and power as the norm.  The size of programs for building programs is huge, and the infrastructure needed to make graphical programs in which the hardware is essentially creating simulations of analogue media but is not offering an opportunity for lean and specific computation of something simple like totals for sports scoring.  </p><p id="P34" class="np">Commercial software for mobile, like word processing software, raises expectations so that everyone uses graphical interfaces that are built in a laborious, code-testing and release cycle; or one that is dependant on integrated code development environments that require several gigabytes of 'coding software'.</p><p id="PLN9" class="intro">Professionals want to link - so let's make tools to do this better on the internet</p><p id="P35" class="np">It may be possible to increase the ease of linking to data by having the capacity to store the data labels (semantic labels) in memory, then shorthand 'link' references to these within a text document can be identified and converted into a link to the relevant document and its link location.  In this way, it is easy to write hyperlinks between documents.  </p><p id="P36" class="np">If there was a way to autotag links between documents, that would make it easier.  One possibility is to identify the document to which a 'memo' responds in the data section, then utilise a cross referencing sytem that is specific to that document name.  After all, the author knows this when they are writing, so having that other document in the same system means it is easy to find.  In this way, sequential arguments can be written and published in a way suitable for the internet too.</p><p id="PLN10" class="intro">Computable formatting</p><p id="P37" class="np">An author may want to identify the list of words that have importance and also want to be displayed in italics, for example.  If an author has the capacity to define the list before calling a function to process them with italic tags for HTML, the author is simultaneously defining them as data, independently of any subsequent use, or how they might appear in a browser. </p><p id="PLN11" class="intro">Macros in a GUI environment are designed differently</p><p id="P38" class="np">The 'search and replace' function in word processors might seem to achieve the same purpose as a MemoScript request to make certain words 'italics', but it is different in that it replicates the mechanical work flow without explicit acknowledgement of the search text as re-usable data.</p><p id="P39" class="np">Language modules have sometimes been added to word processors to help automate functions like search and replace exist.  These include like Visual Basic (VB).   As a general language, Visual Basic (VB) treated interface components as objects.  A script to automate 'search and replace' is usually dependent on the Graphical Interface concept (it frames the script around that GUI assumption).  A script for re-using search buttons does not create a reference to data in memory, nor is it easily modifiable.  These macro languages fail to move the focus away the fixation on mechanical interactions with text.   They do not help focus on the author's information of importance, and abstract ideas.</p><p id="P40" class="np">At a deeper level, languages like VB are built on top of a software engineering system which embodies all of the low-level divisions between mathematical notation and literature, or between text and science.  The lack of subjective goal awareness in these languages always make them feel like using them makes one an outsider to the humanities.  They lack any persistent concern with code and functions that an author (in the humanities) can lean into and treat as their own.</p><p class="footer"><a href="SiteMap.html" class="footer">Site Map</a> | <a href="#Top" class="footer">#Top</a></p><p class="footer">Created by: Craig Duncan 2023-2024</p><p class="footer">Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"class="footer">CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</a></p></body></html>
