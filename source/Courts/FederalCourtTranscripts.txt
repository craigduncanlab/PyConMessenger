Although they say they are getting rid of outdated methods, what they have there as an example is an output publication that still has line numbers on the left and apparently just a text record as it would be for analogue.  The speaker identification may be there for the input, but how is it captured in the output format?  There are no stylistic changes or emboldig for each new speaker there.
