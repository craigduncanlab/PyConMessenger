# High Court of Australia transcripts

The High Court has its own service and makes them available (unlike some other courts).

L:AustliiHCAtrans,http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/,30 July 2024

This is an individual HTML transcript (available on web, but no separate download link).  The HCA offers download versions in PDF and RTF (neither of which are modern XML or semantic formats)

When this is enclosed in an e+ and e- tag section, which is simple HTML, some of it survives being put through my 'script' parser: it will ignore the HTML but some of it will eventually find its way into the output and so be rendered as formatted HTML like the original:

e+
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>   May I deal with three
preliminary matters first.  The plaintiffs require an order under
section 486A(2) of the <i>Migration Act</i> extending the time for making
the applications.  Mr Hill, the Minister did not oppose that order, do you
oppose that order being
made? 
<p><b>MR HILL:</b>   No, we consent to that
order being made, your Honour.
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>   The order will
be that: <br><br></p>
<ol>
<li style='' value='1' value="1">The
period for the making of the applications by the first, second and third
plaintiffs for a constitutional or other writ to this
Court be extended to
27 February 2024.</li></ol><p><br><br>The second preliminary matter is that the
second plaintiff sought an order that she be appointed the litigation guardian
for the third,
fourth, and fifth plaintiffs.  That is also not opposed, Mr
Hill?
<p><b>MR HILL:</b>   That is right, your Honour, that is not
opposed.
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>   That order will also be made:<br><br></p>
<ol>
<li style='' value='2' value="2">The
second plaintiff is appointed litigation for the third, fourth, and fifth
plaintiffs, pursuant to rule 21.08.6 of the <i><a href="/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_reg/hcr2004170/" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Rules 2004</a>
</i>(Cth).</li></ol><p>To the extent necessary, I will dispense with compliance
with rule 21.08.7.  The third preliminary matter on my list, and there may
very well be others, is this application by you, Ms Costello, to amend your
reply.  I might hear from Mr Hill first as to what his
reaction is to it
because I have had no notification in writing or otherwise from the defendant. 
Mr Hill.
<p><b>MR HILL:</b>   Thank you, your Honour.  My
instructions are neither to oppose nor consent to that
application.
e-

There is one semantic class used there (inside an anchor, or 'a' tag):
e+
class="autolink_findacts"
e-

This gives some indication of what is prioritised, i.e. isolated references to legislation over the encoding of the actors, speakers and flow of communications.  Semantics is treated as an optional extra, not the foundation of the document's formatting.

Final sign-offs are not encoded as they might be in a digital source:
e+
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>  
Can I thank both of you for attending.  Adjourn the Court,
please.
<p>
<p><b>AT 9.46 AM THE MATTER WAS ADJOURNED</b></p>
e-

Even if the RTF is generated using some kind of XML for parties, counsel etc it isn't obviously used in the same way for the HTML generation.
