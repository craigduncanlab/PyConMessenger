# High Court of Australia transcripts

The High Court has its own service and makes them available (unlike some other courts).

L:AustliiHCAtrans,http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/,30 July 2024

This is an individual HTML transcript (available on web, but no separate download link).  The HCA offers download versions in PDF and RTF (neither of which are modern XML or semantic formats)

L:2024TransHCA,http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/2024/45.html,30 July 2024

Some of the meta in the HTML section:

When this is enclosed in an e+ and e- tag section, which is simple HTML, some of it survives being put through my 'script' parser: it will ignore the HTML but some of it will eventually find its way into the output and so be rendered as formatted HTML like the original:

e+
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>   May I deal with three
preliminary matters first.  The plaintiffs require an order under
section 486A(2) of the <i>Migration Act</i> extending the time for making
the applications.  Mr Hill, the Minister did not oppose that order, do you
oppose that order being
made? 
<p><b>MR HILL:</b>   No, we consent to that
order being made, your Honour.
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>   The order will
be that: <br><br></p>
<ol>
<li style='' value='1' value="1">The
period for the making of the applications by the first, second and third
plaintiffs for a constitutional or other writ to this
Court be extended to
27 February 2024.</li></ol><p><br><br>The second preliminary matter is that the
second plaintiff sought an order that she be appointed the litigation guardian
for the third,
fourth, and fifth plaintiffs.  That is also not opposed, Mr
Hill?
<p><b>MR HILL:</b>   That is right, your Honour, that is not
opposed.
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>   That order will also be made:<br><br></p>
<ol>
<li style='' value='2' value="2">The
second plaintiff is appointed litigation for the third, fourth, and fifth
plaintiffs, pursuant to rule 21.08.6 of the <i><a href="/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_reg/hcr2004170/" class="autolink_findacts">High Court Rules 2004</a>
</i>(Cth).</li></ol><p>To the extent necessary, I will dispense with compliance
with rule 21.08.7.  The third preliminary matter on my list, and there may
very well be others, is this application by you, Ms Costello, to amend your
reply.  I might hear from Mr Hill first as to what his
reaction is to it
because I have had no notification in writing or otherwise from the defendant. 
Mr Hill.
<p><b>MR HILL:</b>   Thank you, your Honour.  My
instructions are neither to oppose nor consent to that
application.
e-

There is one semantic class used there (inside an anchor, or 'a' tag):
e+
class="autolink_findacts"
e-

This gives some indication of what is prioritised, i.e. isolated references to legislation over the encoding of the actors, speakers and flow of communications.  Semantics is treated as an optional extra, not the foundation of the document's formatting.

Final sign-offs are not encoded as they might be in a digital source:
e+
<p><b>HER HONOUR:</b>  
Can I thank both of you for attending.  Adjourn the Court,
please.
<p>
<p><b>AT 9.46 AM THE MATTER WAS ADJOURNED</b></p>
e-

Even if the RTF is generated using some kind of XML for parties, counsel etc it isn't obviously used in the same way for the HTML generation.

# Federal Court transcripts

I had a problem using this link today (no valid encryption):

With NetScribe, you can provide secure access to audio recordings and formatted documents, more quickly accurately, securely, and economically than possible with traditional tools and processes.
e-

Although they say they are getting rid of outdated methods, what they have there as an example is an output publication that still has line numbers on the left and apparently just a text record as it would be for analogue.  The speaker identification may be there for the input, but how is it captured in the output format?  There are no stylistic changes or emboldig for each new speaker there.

# Queensland Transcripts

They offer a transcripts guidebook:

L:QldTranscripts,https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/services/transcripts-and-recordings,30 July 2024

(That version 3: 17 July 2023: Transcript Format and Style Guide)

which is available as a PDF:

L:PDFTranscriptGuide,https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/641245/guideline-transcript-format-style-guide.pdf,30 July 2024

This is written as a style guide (i.e. for the finished result: the published document, as read in analogue form by a human being).  It also offers thoughts on how to filter the sounds of direct speech into an edited transcript.

The way in which it deals with recording events is to refer to concepts like 'banner entries', e.g. "RECORDING PLAYED" .  Concepts like opening address banners, closing address banners etc.  These are the markings of a traditional document, something that is not really comprehended as something that can be both digital and analogue at the same time, interpretd differently, by different software, for different purposes.  In fact, there are even statements pushing back on the inclusion of explicit !!analogue!! information (without even considering digital processing):

q+
Let the transcript speak for itself.
There is no need to include a WITNESS STOOD DOWN banner.
(p167)
q-

There are examples of how transcript is laid out (and in this respect, a transcript does resemble a play, especially with the use of capitalised words to denote who is speaking).  Below is one of the examples from the transcript manual (Qld).  However, it has no direct reference to the semantics of the document, or how transcripts might be, alternatively, offered as a semantic document.  Example:
e+
HER HONOUR:
MR B. BROWN: the accused.
HER HONOUR:
Thank you, Ms Green.
Brown, your Honour, initial B., instructed by Legal Aid Queensland, for
Thank you.
MS TEMPLETON: I present an indictment against Joe Bloggs charging him with assault. I ask that he be arraigned upon that indictment.
HER HONOUR: Yes. Joe Bloggs, would you stand up. Arraign the accused.
ASSOCIATE: Joe Bloggs, you stand charged by that name that on the 18th day of October 2007 at Wacol in the State of Queensland you assaulted Jane Doe. How say you, are you guilty or not guilty?
DEFENDANT: Not guilty.
HER HONOUR: Inform the accused of his right of challenge and empanel the jury, please.
.. .
MS GREEN OPENED THE CASE FOR THE CROWN

e-

The means of introducing auto-tagging information for plays can be adapted to the context of transcripts too (which are written with text-assist, no doubt).  There are other, explicit ways of including explanatory information that acts as a delimiter too.  For example, the milestone of the opening could be encoded so that it was easier to pick up (and this would be easy to train the transcript recording people (stenographers) to include as marker text):

e+
OPEN:CROWN
OPENBY:Ms GREEN
e-

With some very small adjustments, local semantic encoding could be used for new witnesses, or they could be included in a data section. e.g. 

e+
W:JANE JAYNE DOE
WS:9.50am
WE:CHIEF
WC:MS GREEN
e-

# NAMES

On page 189/253 of the PDF it details how to set out names in the documents, especially those for the police force.  This is an example of how conventions start with the Court and then find their way into reports.  It's this kind of weighting of text that was then detected in the frequency counting process undertaken by Allison Whittaker in BlakWork.  

see /WhittakerBlakwork/.
