SavingsAccount 3 $301.85 interest
SavingsAccount 4 $111.10 interest
HighInterest 5 $65.19 interest
SavingsAccount 3 $137.87 interest

colnames(AccountName,AccountNumber,Gross,Description)
dlim(space all)
rip(Accounts)
tablecol(AccountName,AccountNumber,Gross,Description)

List test

lprint(Accounts)

Code:

codeprint(Accounts)

Numbered:

nprint(Accounts)

A quote:

qprint(Accounts)

Here's another version of this table, with totals using the tablecoltotals() function.  This uses a verbose format in which you specify the column data you want (previously prepared from the above data), and it is combined into the table:

tablecoltotals(AccountName,AccountNumber,Gross,Description)


ripacross(Accounts)
sum(Gross)

Just row totals:

rowtotals(Accounts)
tablecol(auto_ref,auto_total)

This is the raw data:

This is the same data as a list print (lprint):

lprint(CricketMad2)

This is a summary of the player scores (rowtotals):

rowtotals(CricketMad2)
tablecol(auto_ref,auto_total)

Same data with tprintrows
tprintrows(CricketMad2)

Summary with extra stats: same data with cprintrows()
cprintrows(CricketMad2)

Now some bowlers data.  eprint()
eprint(Bowlers)

And with cricket print cprintrows()

cprintrows(Bowlers)
