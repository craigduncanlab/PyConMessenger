C:Some ideas about meta comics

# Intro

I could just record my thoughts on the state of digital literature and formats and so on, but what if there was a character, an agent, representing in visual (comic) form who could act as a guide, and speak to the audience.  i.e. a narrator who seems to have an incorporeal existence, rather than just being the unobserved writer.  What advantages does this give?  How does it bring the reader into the medium?  Does it help with personification?

In a way, what SP did with L&B was to draw people in with characters so as to illustrate some of the historical events, but breaking the fourth wall occurred in a way that was seamless: the fantasy element of the text was that it allowed the characters to be reinhabited without them having to be confined to their historical existence, yet allowing them a familiarity with that history and so to deconstruct it in a modern way.

This is a kind of fictionalised history (and SP had studied arts history).

The introduction of a character distances the author from having a particular opinion.  It can be the character's opinion.  This is how some satirical novels function.  It also means that the qualities of the character (a bit like Doyle's Holmes) are always a filtered creation, suited to purpose, and not meant to be representative of the author's entire persona.

# Metacomics as a genre


I'm not sure there's a defined genre of Metacomics but if there isn't, then I'm going to create it.  Maybe even the domain metacomic or metacomics could be the forum for a metacomic on any topic?

In some ways, metacomics where they take the form of illustrated characters or guides, found in text books, are probably already in existence, but I'm not sure if anyone has thought of introducing them into the revitalisation of interest into topics that were a bit sad or neglected (and creating something more suitable to a general audience. e.g. metacomics and observations on Bates, rather than just academic papers and liguistic notes, for example).

The 'character' in Padua's work was the same character (indistinguishable in some ways from the characters in those events), yet if another character, from a different time was introduced, it would also change the reader's relation to both the character and the events.  Immersive characters, like in L&B, are slightly removed from their historical reality, but they are not reinvented as observers: they are simultaneously participant and fourth-wall breaker.  In that respect, their characters are altered because they may not have been fourth-wall breakers by nature (although for revolutionary thinkers, that claim might not be so difficult).  They are also altered because scenes may be constructed that involve constructing meetings that involved more people than actually met in real life, or in which events are reconstructed to illustrate themes rather then situations.

Political cartoonists are involved to some degree in making characters of people in our own time, taking them out and subjecting them to event and criticism that the comic author does not feel comfortable doing in person (and perhaps reflecting laws protecting the powerful or who can afford to hire lawyers to suppress criticism, like defamation laws).

In the radio forum, Roy & HG represent meta-characters for an aural meta-comic: they are playing characters ostensibly 'in' the subject they are describing, but able to break the fourth wall, or offer observational insights disguised as 'expertise'.  The characters are a way of distancing the real authors from their criticisms, and allowing hyperbole and humour.  On the other hand, the themes of this are not so heavily weighted toward education and intellectual rigours but more in the way of a parody of other commercial offerings in relation to sport (and cultural obsessions with it).  

In comparision to abbreviated radio offerings, the meta-comic can be integrated into a textual !!and!! visual medium, thereby offering some of the breaking of the fourth wall, but not necessarily a parody of other historical and present matters: it can be more in the way of distance, reframing and pointing out absurdity, rather than direct mocking humour.
