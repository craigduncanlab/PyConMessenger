Also note this (from 2018-2020):

Unzip it! An epub file is just a bunch of HTML, CSS, images (& maybe fonts) in a zip file. You could extract it to a folder and just remove the (.xhtml) files you don’t want, then zip up the structure and rename to .epub.
Use an editor. You could use an epub editor. Calibre comes with its own editor. Once it’s installed you should have an Open with E-book Editor option in your right-click menu in your file manager AND Edit book from Calibre’s right-click menu. Sigil is another excellent editor.

# Sigil

This application was based on editing the HTML format, and eBooks.  It did have WYSIWYG support, which is now separated into the companion app PageEdit, but otherwise still continues with a mainly text based editing environment.

The demo pictures suggest that Sigil uses p class approach for a substantial part of its formatting, but it is layout (publication) focussed and not semantics.

It can download news, converts it to eBook format etc.  These are still an HTML-style presentation (with scroller to go up/down).
