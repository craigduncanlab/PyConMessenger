The eBook form is not in fully semantic encoding:
l+
it does use p tags !*and*! a few semantic classes, but not for all kinds of relevant information
it excludes character names, stage directions : these are not distinct p tag classes. 
(character names are highlighted through layout-based span, in introductory sections, but are not captured there as one of the principle data types).

The use of a single field 'drama' for all the text, without identifying the speakers in the body of the document is also an oversight.

# Notes on layout of text

The 'table' form of the Dramatis Personae is useful, since it sets out the capitalised names that will appear in the play, and then a description.  However, there are some abiguities in the data in that table which could be easily clarified to help with the computational tasks and preprocessing HTML.

# Data table cleaning for HTML  

For example, the references to a Scottish doctor and an English doctor are clear enough int he descriptions, but they are not named.  The word 'DOCTOR' in the play is clear from context, but for the purposes of data, we'd probably need to distinguish them by their region, or call them DOCTOR1 and DOCTOR2 or suchlike.

There is also reference to three witches but they are not named.  In the play, they are distinguished.

# NP (Nice Processor) upstream processing language

We can use computation to help with the automated application of styles.

To do this, we need a function that can take a list of possible values ('Character' variable) and then apply the 'authorref' style to it, like this:

e+
autotagline(Character,authorref)
e-

Consequences:
l+
we can make use of our previous definition of data variables.
We can tag any lines matching these conditions with a particular class at the time of making HTML
