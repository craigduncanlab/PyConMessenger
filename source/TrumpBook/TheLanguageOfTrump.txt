He’s incapable of empathy for Biden; he’s just inserting names as cover but basically talking about his own reaction were it him (as a sitting President unwilling to give up power).   

Since he lacks empathy and opportunity to be President he laments Biden having opportunities to act inconsistently with his own desires.  These kind of outbursts can never make sense literally because it’s blended projection and pathology.

This is more of a weird projection by someone who interprets things in relation to his own desires.   He doesn’t really empathise with Biden, only himself.

At least part of this scree is seeing himself as sitting President, being challenged (any challenge to his desire for power is now a coup to him), and his fears about elections and the limitation of tenure.  He lives in the zone where past, present and future are intermingled with him still at the centre.

He has spent years inserting other peoples names into his self loathing and this seems to be another example.

# The Language of Projection

This is a weird form of encoding: the person fills the subject with other people's names, and without needing fact or empathy with other people, inserts their own fears, desires and grievances into those statements.  The person hides behind a verbal mask, just like the constant mask of identity they hide behind to disguise their self-loathing; their fear of being imperfect; their fear of making mistakes.

As a result, there is no pause to ask : what does Biden really think about, care about, or do in his life?  The people that endorse this kind of behaviour by Trump have so little concern for themselves they are willing to put aside their own agency and ask that Trump achieve worth, and power, on behalf of themselves.   They don't really care about outsiders, because Trump has to walk on 'others' in order to lift himself up.   These people live for vengeance, because they have no joy or humour in their lives either.

# Good Takes

Some people are wise to this (and will even invoke George Costanza references to give further examples).
