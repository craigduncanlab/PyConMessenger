# intro

You can see how vacant Trump is when he asks his rally audience whether he should say Crooked Joe or Sleepy Joe.

He can't talk himself up, so he makes fictious 'bad guys' to compare himself to (i.e. he insinuates he is better than a fake opponent).  Pathologically disturbed.  He can't even compare himself to the current candidates.
