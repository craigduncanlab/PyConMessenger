# UN agenda 2030 and AI

UN is all in on AI (i.e. will exploit it where it can)

"78/311	Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-building of Artificial Intelligence	A/78/L.86 adopted on 1 July 2024 without a vote (A/78/PV.97) under item 13."

Where is the definition of artifical intelligence?  The entire premise/framing is based on a concept that is as malleable as they want it to be.  No one cares.  ??

The way these resolutions are drafted with emphasises, affirms etc is so boring and probably pointless in many cases.  But it does provide an opportunity for text parsing.
