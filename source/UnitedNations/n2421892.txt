The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity
I. The small island developing States story
1. In 1992, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, we, the international community, formally declared small island developing States a special case both for environment and development and committed to assist them in meeting their sustainable development objectives. This was further promulgated in the first decennial United Nations conference on small island developing States in Barbados in 1994 and was subsequently reiterated at the second conference in Mauritius in 2005 and the third conference in Samoa in 2014.
2. After three decades and three programmes of action, small island developing States remain a special case for sustainable development, given their unique vulnerabilities. We note the remarkable successes and progress that they have made over the years, and welcome in this regard the ownership, leadership and considerable efforts that have been demonstrated by small island developing States, along with the support provided by the international community.
3. During this period, small island developing States have and continue to provide stable and democratic governance for their citizenry and have strived to provide productive economies and safe societies throughout unrelenting turbulent global times. Small island developing States were heavily affected by two “once-in-a- generation” crises that struck in 2008 and 2020, while grappling with even more intense and frequent disasters and natural hazards. In addition, they have assumed leadership roles in areas such as finance, climate change and plastics, and are stewards of the ocean, including managing 19.1 per cent of the world’s exclusive economic zones and the resources they hold. Small island developing States have paved the way for many of the most progressive movements in these areas in policy development and the establishment of concrete actions in the multilateral arena.
4. We remain concerned that small island developing States are facing the unrelenting and compounding impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, disasters and natural hazards, health and other social-related challenges and economic vulnerabilities, as well as the progressive deterioration in their ability to withstand external shocks and enhance their resilience. Successive global crises, along with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, have further exacerbated and negatively compounded the sustainable development of small island developing States.
5. Small island developing States are inherently and uniquely vulnerable to exogenous shocks owing to, inter alia, their small size, geographical remoteness, highly dispersed populations, the limited scale and undiversified nature of their economies, high dependence on external markets, and extreme exposure to disasters and natural hazards and the effects of climate change. Recognizing vulnerability does not mean that small island developing States exhibit weakness or lack potential for development. Rather, it means recognizing that they are disproportionately impacted in terms of physical destruction and non-economic and economic losses to a far greater scale than elsewhere.
6. Small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change, including, inter alia, erratic precipitation, increasingly frequent and extreme weather phenomena, more frequent and severe tropical cyclones, floods and drought, diminishing freshwater resources, desertification, coastal erosion, land degradation and sea level rise, which represent the gravest of threats to the survival and viability of their people, natural ecosystems and overall sustainable development.

The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity
We take note of the concerns expressed by small island developing States that the impacts of climate change could have possible implications on small island developing States, including humanitarian, economic, social, cultural, ecological and, as exacerbated by other factors, security consequences.
7. In order for small island developing States to achieve sustainable development and resilient prosperity, we must assist small island developing States to diversify their economies and strengthen State and productive capacities. At the same time, the international financial architecture should go further to fully address the unique development circumstances of small island developing States and make accessing concessional finance easier for them, which could mitigate their fiscal constraints and reduce the risk of indebtedness, especially for highly indebted small island developing States, and prevent the reversal of hard-earned development gains. Therefore, the special case of small island developing States must continue to be recognized by the international community and must take into account these new and emerging challenges.
8. We recognize small island developing States’ need for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, particularly renewable energy. Small island developing States are facing significant barriers related to accessing finance, cost of capital, market readiness and upskilling and reskilling workforces needed for just, inclusive and resilient energy transitions.
9. We reaffirm the importance of freedom, peace and security, respect for all human rights, including the right to development and the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to food, the rule of law, gender equality, women’s empowerment, reducing inequalities and the overall commitment to just and democratic societies for development.
10. We recognize that gender equality and women’s empowerment and the full realization of human rights for women and girls have a transformative and multiplier effect on sustainable development and are a driver of economic growth in small island developing States. Women can be powerful agents of change.
11. Small island developing States aspire to a resilient form of prosperity that is reflected in sustainable development for all in their countries, where economic growth and well-being are sustained and their economies are robust, diversified, adaptable and able to withstand shocks, ensuring social equity and promoting environmental sustainability.
12. The next 10 years are critical for small island developing States. A new context is emerging wherein the economic, social and environmental as well as geopolitical threats to the development of small island developing States are so great that they can only be ameliorated by a reinvigorated enabling environment that gives meaningful effect to their sustainable development. Without the full support of the international community, small island developing States will endure potentially far-reaching consequences.
13. We reaffirm the continued applicability of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (Barbados Programme of Action)1 adopted in 1994, the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island

16. We, the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives, having met in St. John’s from 27 to 30 May 2024, at the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States, with the participation of civil society, the private sector, youth, academia and other relevant stakeholders, firmly reaffirm our commitment to support small island developing States on their pathway to achieving sustainable development and resilient prosperity, where the progress of today does not compromise the possibilities of tomorrow. Through targeted, results-focused interventions and investments, we will support small island developing States as they exercise full ownership of their new agenda and seek to establish partnerships as equals, upholding values of equity, national ownership, mutual trust, transparency and accountability, and cooperation and promoting benefits across priority areas in their new 10-year agenda.
II. What do small island developing States want?
A. Build resilient economies
17. Enhancing inter-island connectivity and linking economies of small island developing States to regional markets and global supply chains, including by integrating them into existing and emerging maritime and multimodal transport and economic corridors, and encouraging sustainable transport initiatives to support small island developing States remains key.
18. We underscore that small island developing States face substantial structural challenges in building the necessary ecosystem, institutions and capacity for promoting and using science, technology, innovation and digitalization to drive economic growth and sustainable development.

27. We acknowledge that the widespread, rapid and adverse impacts of climate change continue to pose increasing risks to small island developing States and their efforts to achieve sustainable development, while representing the greatest threats to the survival and viability of their people and natural ecosystems. Even with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, small island developing States will continue to incur severe loss and damage.
  10/21
24-13495

The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity
28. Small island developing States are gravely concerned that global emissions are not in line with modelled global mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, and that there is a rapidly narrowing window out to 2030 to raise ambition and implement existing commitments in order to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels within reach, which is crucial to the sustainable development of small island developing States.
29. Small island developing States have extraordinary marine and terrestrial biodiversity that, in many cases, is fundamental to their livelihoods, culture and identity, but their vulnerabilities are drastically limiting the resources and means by which they can protect their ecosystems and the natural environment. The ocean and its resources are under considerable stress from anthropogenic sources, impacting small island developing States, which are especially dependent on their maritime resources for their food security and livelihoods.
30. Small island developing States seek the support of the international community to:
(a) Urgently take action on climate change by:
(i) Accelerated actions on the effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, guided by science and agreed principles;
(ii) Supporting the recruitment and development of technical expertise to facilitate the development of loss and damage response plans and actions, including risk assessment, loss modelling, governance, management, disbursement, monitoring, evaluation and reporting on loss and damage solutions and impacts;
(iii) Recognizing the important role of forests in climate mitigation and adaptation, including through promoting the adoption and implementation of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, on the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests in developing countries, as well as other alternative policy approaches in small island developing States, including those with high forest low deforestation (HFLD) regions, as per article 5.2 of the Paris Agreement, on national or, an interim basis, subnational jurisdictional scales, can foster information exchange, expertise-sharing and collective problem-solving, fostering a united effort in addressing climate mitigation and adaptation goals, and also noting it is essential for those small island developing States that have maintained forest cover and other ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass, peatlands, old-growth forests, and marshes, over decades of sustainable management and use to pursue opportunities to mobilize financing in this regard;
(b) Conserve and sustainably use the ocean and its resources by:
(i) Ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of aquaculture, mariculture, tourism and fisheries, such as through the implementation of measures to end illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing for mutually reinforcing economic and environmental benefits;
(ii) Addressing biodiversity loss caused by harmful human activities, including inadequate waste management and unsustainable production and consumption, including of plastics; overfishing; illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; introduction of alien invasive species; noise and light pollution; coral bleaching, ocean acidification, eutrophication and harmful algal blooms; and coastal erosion, including through measures such as, inter alia,

(v) Reducing disaster risks, including by building protective infrastructure and enhancing resilience of freshwater and other water systems, and using the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phases after a disaster to increase resilience, and developing systems for managing evacuations and the distribution of basic relief support.
III. How do small island developing States get there?
31. While acknowledging the primary responsibility of small island developing States for their own sustainable development, we recognize that the persistent development challenges of the small island developing States require enhanced global partnership for development, adequate provision and mobilization of all means of implementation and continued international support to achieve internationally agreed goals.
32. Therefore, to realize the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States by 2034, we, the international community, commit to the following actions:
A. Build economic resilience

We value the role of the United Nations system in supporting small island developing States to achieve their sustainable development objectives and request all United Nations development system entities to contribute to the implementation of, and to integrate, the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States into their strategic and work plans, in accordance with their mandates.
34. We underline the need to give due consideration to the issues and concerns of small island developing States in all relevant major United Nations conferences and processes and the relevant work of the United Nations development system.
35. We call upon the United Nations system to ensure country and multi-country offices of all United Nations entities operating in small island developing States are well resourced, with staff with the appropriate skills, experience, country context and capacities to operate effectively, and to avoid vacancies at the country level, particularly in resident coordinator offices.
36. We request the Secretary-General, in his annual report to the General Assembly at its eightieth session on the implementation of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States, to present proposals to ensure a coordinated, coherent and effective United Nations system-wide capacity-development approach to small island developing States and to enhance the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Agenda, including a potential single SIDS-dedicated entity at the Secretariat.
37. We also request the Secretary-General, in consultation with States, including through the Steering Committee on Partnerships for Small Island Developing States, to present recommendations for the strengthening of the Small Island Developing States Partnership Framework and the Small Island Developing States Global Business Network and its Forum.
